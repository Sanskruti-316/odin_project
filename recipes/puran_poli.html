            <li>Divide the dough and the puran mixture into equal portions.</li>
            <li>Roll out a portion of dough into a small circle. Place a portion of puran in the center and fold the edges over to seal it.</li>
            <li>Gently roll out the stuffed dough into a flat circle (poli).</li>
            <li>Heat a tawa or skillet and cook the puran poli on both sides until golden brown, applying ghee as needed.</li>
